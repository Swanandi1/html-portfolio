<h1>The Best Movies According to Swanandi</h1>
<h2>My  top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3> Yeh Jawanni Hai Deewani</h3>
  <p> This movie is amazing.The characters,the plot are very intresting and relatable to us in our own life situations
    It was the first movie in hindi which i liked and would watch it many times now too without getting bored of it</p>
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
   <p> It was my second watched anime but i liked this one much more because the animation in this is awesome and also breathtaking.
    Gojo and Sukuna are the main leads in this and this anime is about monsters who are living in the human world and how these jujutsu sorcers,
    take down those monsters and win.   </p>
<h3> Passengers</h3>
   <p> This movies theme is amazing and the VFX in it was incredibly shown. Chris Patt did an awesome role in this along with
    his co-actors. This movie is about the human population moving to another planet just like earth with a spaceship
    and how they survive while one of the passenger wakes up in middle of  the journey when everyone is bound to sleep. </p>
